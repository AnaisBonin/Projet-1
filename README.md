This is our first project, within the 3 first weeks starting our journey at the Wild Code School.
This project is supposed to be mainly coded in HTML and CSS and will integrate just a few lines of JS.

The purpose of this website is to display where we live and give you a little tour. 

Since the goal is mostly to learn coding, we kept some Lorem Ipsum in order to focus on the technical challenge.
